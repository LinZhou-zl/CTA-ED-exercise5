# Feedback: CTA exercise 5 (2024)

# question 1
# -----------------------------------------------------------

# question 2
# -----------------------------------------------------------


# question 3
# -----------------------------------------------------------


# overall code quality: 
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# you didn't knit your doc and I wasn't able to knit it myself because there were code errors early on. 
# in future make sure you knit your doc again when you're done with the code as that is what the assessment will be based on. 
# overall your code looks mostly fine but shows little adaptation from the exercise, and you don't comment/explain your code enough
# (use hashtags in code lines to explain things, e.g.)

table (a,b) # building a table for variables a and b

# there are also code errors at various points that prevent the knitting of your doc.

# overall interpretation: 
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# The biggest failing here is that you do not explain your analyses (e.g. why this many topics etc) and you do not interpret your analyses at alL; You just run the code but do not explain what we learn from the analysis
# you MUST interpret outputs for the final assignment: it is a very big part of the final assessment so make sure you put a lot more focus on making sense of your analyses
# and what they tell us about the text etc
